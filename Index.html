                <h3>What does being social mean?</h3>
                <p>
                    Social to us means that you are interacting with another person face-to-face, not online chatting with other people. 
                </p>

                <h3>What we think information technology is doing to you</h3>
                <p>We think information technology is making people less social. People are on their phones like 24 7. It has became a habit to the newer generations to check on their phones once in a while. When friends are hanging out, we often start using our phone and forget about the friends around us. It happens in family meetings too. Children get phones at a young age. Now a days, children get a iphone when they’re only in second grade! As technology and social media has become apart of people’s daily life, it has also made people less social to people face to face and more social in talking to people through the internet. Some people now are more willing to chat with a stranger online and be around actual people.</p>

                    About a decade ago, Robert Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard University, wrote a book called Bowling Alone. He explained how Americans became less social (as in face to face)  with others than they were in the 1950s. People now are less likely to around their friends but instead they’re at homes about half as often as they did just a few decades before, Social media is changing the relationship between people. When friends are hanging out, they spend more time on social media than talking and chatting with each other face to face. The support systems people have are even moving to technology, In 2006, sociologists from the University of Arizona and Duke University made a study called “Social Isolation in America.” This study compared the 1985 and 2004 responses to the General Social Survey. They found that the average American’s support system is technology.

                <h3>Interview 1</h3>
                <ul class="w3-ul w3-content">
                    <li>Q: What does social means to you?</li>
                    <li>A: Social mean interacting with other humans through face-to-face interaction</li>
                    <li>Q: Do you think makes teenagers technology more or less social? Why?</li>
                    <li>A: I think technology makes teenagers less social because it can stunt social skills as well as preventing you from interacting with friends and family.</li>
                    <li>Q: Do you think that information and communication technologies (ICTs) affect your behavior or other people’s behavior? And why (yes or no)?</li>
                    <li>A: I think that the it affects people's behavior. It affects the behavior because something you might not say in real life might be said over a media platform or they might act as a entirely different person online.</li>
                    <li>Q: How often do you spend time with friends face-to-face? Do ICTs affect this? If yes how?</li>
                    <li>A: I spend 3-5 hours with friends face to face. ICTs sometimes affect this.</li>
                    <li>Q: Do you think that ICTs create a false sense of reality?</li>
                    <li>A: I don't think that ICTs create a false sense of reality.</li>
                    <li>Q: Do you think our/ new generation should use more or less technology to interact with people?</li>
                    <li>A: I think our generation should try using less technology if it starts interfering with human interaction ex: if there are friends nearby but you would prefer to be using social media.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Interview 2</h3>
                <ul class="w3-ul w3-content">
                    <li>Q: What does social means to you?</li>
                    <li>A: Meeting with other humans in person</li>
                    <li>Q: Do you think makes teenagers technology more or less social? Why?</li>
                    <li>A: I think technology makes teen less social because it keeps them inside, usually isolated, for hours on end. I think this greatly impacts their social skills.</li>
                    <li>Q: Do you think that information and communication technologies (ICTs) affect your behavior or other people’s behavior? And why (yes or no)?</li>
                    <li>A: I do think that they affect people’s behavior. I think a lot of people use it as a mask, something they can hide behind. I think they act very different when online then when in person, they feel invincible</li>
                    <li>Q: How often do you spend time with friends face-to-face? Do ICTs affect this? If yes how?</li>
                    <li>A: Not counting school, I try to meet with friends / socialize at least once or twice a weekend. ICT’s do affect this, though, as my phone and xbox take up a lot of my time at home</li>
                    <li>Q: Do you think that ICTs create a false sense of reality?</li>
                    <li>I do. I think that people use ICTs as a barrier between them and the real world, creating a figurative copy of themselves, on the internet</li>
                    <li>Q: Do you think our/ new generation should use more or less technology to interact with people?</li>
                    <li>A: I think that technology is not a bad thing, I think to communicate we should focus on things like facetime, or talking to someone. It becomes a lot more important when talking to someone then texting them.</li>

                <p>The results show that people mostly define social interaction to be everything, while abut 50% of people have ICTs effecting face-to-face interaction. This also shows that people are more open and maniplutive of their identity online.</p>
